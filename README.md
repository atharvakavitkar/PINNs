# Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
Despite significant advances in numerically modeling multiphysics systems, it is still not possible to effectively incorporate noisy data into current techniques. Furthermore, addressing inverse problems with hidden physics is sometimes prohibitively costly, demanding several formulations and complex computer algorithms. Machine learning has emerged as a viable alternative, however deep neural network training needs large amounts of data, which is not always accessible for scientific issues. Rather, such networks may be developed using new data collected by imposing physical laws. This type of physics-informed learning incorporates (noisy) data with mathematical models, which are then implemented using neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Furthermore, customized network architectures that automatically meet certain of the physical invariants for higher accuracy, faster training, and enhanced generalization may be plausible. This review discusses some of the current trends in integrating physics into deep learning, as well as some of the current deep learning architectures, how they work, and the results obtained on various applications of physics- informed learning, both forward and inverse, such as discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.
